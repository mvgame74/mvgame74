### Hi there, I'm Maria :raising_hand_woman:👋
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌱 I’m currently job hunting after finishing my bootcamp course in Makers Academy, looking for opportunities to work as a junior software developer

I trained originally in software development Bootcamp (Fycsa, dependant on Alcatel) in 2001 in Spain (based on C, extending to HTML, SQL, Javascript, and a bit of Java), and that was the start of my career in my country. Once I arrived in the UK I understood this previous training was already obsolete, so after a stint working in retail, I decided to re-start a career in software development. I loved the feeling of going to work to solve "a puzzle" every day.

I enjoy learning, and in software development, you are constantly improving and evolving. That keeps your brain switched on and it´s personally very satisfying.

I think my brain works as a sort of a database, so I always found a certain affinity to working with data, the simplicity of well-thought tables, connections, queries, and the best way to present information (which heavily influences decision making afterward).
But what I was most credited in my previous jobs was for my management skills: it's not something that was natural for me, but I grew to love it, especially the part of aiding my team to grow and develop themselves. The best compliment I ever received when they left their positions, or I left my job, is that they would love to work for me again, which makes me very proud.
