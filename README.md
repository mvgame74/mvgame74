### Hi there, I'm Maria :raising_hand_woman:👋
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌱 I’m currently job hunting after finishing my bootcamp course in Makers Academy, looking for opportunities to work as a junior software developer.

My curiosity for software development led me to do a software development bootcamp back in 2001 Spain (Fycsa, an Alcatel subsidiary), based on C, extending to HTML, SQL, Javascript, and a bit of Java, and that was the start of my career back in Spain.

Once I arrived to the UK, it was clear to me that, this previous training was already obsolete, so after a stint working in retail, I decided to re-start a career in software development because I loved the feeling of going to work to solve a "puzzle" every day.

My previous work experience in the airline industry, management and retail means I have a wealth of transferable skills that I can apply and continue developing in any future projects.

# Skills 

## Problem Solving
When something does not work the way it should be, my focus goes inmediately to identify what's wrong and find the solution: in my job in IATA I was sent to Israel to check the situation of their account and procedded to do the reconciliation of collections and payments (the system varies from one country to another, so the task involved a lot of checks, contacting the banks and gathering the correct info, plus perform the tasks needed to correct the issues), because the person they hired just walked away. I think problem solving is a actitude, no matter if it is in IT or in real life.

## Love Learning
I enjoy learning new things or broadening my knowledge. I think it's part of wanting to understand how things work, how can you do something in a certain way, and even understanding how other people would solve it that brought me back to programming: The idea of constantly learn something new and improve my skills. My experience training during these times has taught me to adapt to any circumstances, to work autonomously and rely on my own skills to look for a solution and investigate by my own means.

## Delivery
I take resposability for any task I take, to do my best and to fullfill my commitments. In my previous job in IATA we have very strict lines of timing for payments, with very little of margin for error, and the assurance of 100% done on time was my personal badge of honor, even working with systems as unreliable as Middle East and Africa.

## Teamleading
My experience as a manager for almost a decade has brought me from being a "reluctant manager" to being one of the tasks I enjoy the most: The mix of bringing the best out of your team and help them grow to the best potential, so the team can make the best contribution possible to the project is something that to me feels like "I made this work", through  providing a clear perspective and good communication.
