### Hi there, I'm Maria :raising_hand_woman:👋
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌱 I’m currently job hunting after finishing my bootcamp course in Makers Academy, preparing to be a junior software developer

I trained originally in software development Bootcamp (Fycsa, dependant on Alcatel) in 2001 in Spain (based on C, extending to HTML, SQL, Javascript, and a bit of Java), and that was the start of my career in my country. Once I arrived in the UK I understood this previous training was already obsolete, so after a stint working in retail, I decided to re-start a career in software development. I loved the feeling of going to work to solve "a puzzle" every day.
