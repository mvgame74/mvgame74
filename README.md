### Hi there, I'm Maria :raising_hand_woman:👋
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌱 I’m currently job hunting after finishing my bootcamp course in Makers Academy, looking for opportunities to work as a junior software developer.

My curiosity for  software development moved me to train originally in software development Bootcamp (Fycsa, dependant on Alcatel) in 2001 in Spain (based on C, extending to HTML, SQL, Javascript, and a bit of Java), and that was the start of my career in my country. Once I arrived in the UK I understood this previous training was already obsolete, so after a stint working in retail, I decided to re-start a career in software development because I loved the feeling of going to work to solve a "puzzle" every day.

I enjoy learning, and in software development, you are constantly improving and evolving. That keeps your brain switched on and it's personally very satisfying.
